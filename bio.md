Max Rydahl Andersen is the tooling architect at JBoss by Red Hat.

Day-to-day he leads the development behind JBoss Tools and JBoss Developer Studio.

In the early days he worked on Hibernate Core even before it became
part of JBoss, and over time he have been involved in alot of projects
at JBoss, mainly focused on the tooling/developer aspects.

He gets to touch upon almost every technology inside JBoss as they
need tooling. It's given him a unique viewpoint of being an actual
user of the technology - feeling both the pains and joys of a user.
