Hibern8IDE - What was it ?
------------------

A quick'n'dirty interactive Hibernate Query Language (HQL) tool that I
wrote the groundworks for in 3 hours a dark night... + some days of my
holiday ;)

Today the tool is renamed to Hibernate Console and part
of the official Hibernate Toolset.

See [tools.hibernate.org](http://tools.hibernate.org) for more.
